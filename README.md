## About Me
Hi, I’m Yaro.
I swapped logistics and tech support for the wild world of software development in Austria. I like my code how I like my coffee: efficient, easy to maintain, and ideally not causing chaos at 2 AM. I rely on structure, honest work, and the occasional help from AI when Stack Overflow runs dry.

### I’m interested in
- Software development with Java  
- Problem-solving and continuous learning

### Currently
- Working at a telecom company as a technical support specialist  
- Training to become a software developer  
- Always on the lookout for better ways to learn and grow in the development field

### Technologies & Tools I use
- **Languages:** Java, SQL, Spring  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Docker/Podman, OKD/OpenShift, JBoss/Wildfly, Postman/SoapUI  
- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows
