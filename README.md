## About Me
Hi, I’m Yaro.
I swapped logistics and tech support for the wild world of software development in Austria. I rely on structure, honest work, and the occasional help from AI when Stack Overflow runs dry.Also, I’m pretty good at vibe-coding — writing code in flow, without overthinking — and no, it’s not embarrassing. It’s how creativity meets problem-solving.
